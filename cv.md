### Briefly about myself:

Hello, I'm 27 years old lecturer at the university. My name and surname you could check on the top of this CV so let's skip this part. 

Being in high school I created my first site of WWII motorcycles using HTML Editor. It was ugly and lowfunctional program, but then, I was a God of Front-End because everyone was doing it in notepad. It was about 5-6 pages with inline styles but it was perfect. I achieved the best mark among all my classmates. Unfortunately, this site was lost... Then I almost forgot my passion because life was going on too fast and it was hard to drive it.

This year I decided to revive my passion, skills and make comeback to WWW. So let's roll!

### Code Example:

**"Counting sheep..." from CodeWars:** *Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present). For example:*
```
[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
```
*The correct answer would be 17.*

**My solution:**

```
let number = [];
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
	let positiveArr = arrayOfSheep.filter(function (number) {
		return number === true;
	});
  return positiveArr.length;
}
```
